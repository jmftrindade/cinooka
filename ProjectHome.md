# Cinooka #

Cinooka (from "Sinuca", which means billiard in Portuguese) is an open source 3D billiard game, written in OpenGL. This was our final project for the "Computer Graphics" course at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil. We received the 2nd best grade for this project in that semester.

This project uses a physics module originally written by Roberto Carraretto (rc.carraretto@gmail.com).
